The **SfPricingDev** project shows a first cut at replicating and improving upon an AtomicPricing widget, but rendered as a Blazor component.

The **SfPricing** components has been hard-coded to support the author's own products and pricing.  It should be straightfoward to generalize the SfPricingWidget component, but  I'll leave that as an exercise to others.

Before running SfPricingDev, you'll need to obtain a Syncfusion license (see below).  Once obtained, the license key should be added to appsettings.json or secrets.json.  Be sure to use the later if oferring pull-request(s) since we don't want to include credentials within the codebase.

To register for a free Syncfusion Blazor account and use their components, you can follow these steps:

**Visit Syncfusion's Website**: <a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/" target="_blank">https://www.syncfusion.com/</a>.

**Create an Account**: If you don’t already have a Syncfusion account, you’ll need to create one. You can typically do this by clicking on a "Sign In" or "Register" link and providing your details.

**Find the Community License**: Syncfusion offers a Community License that is free for individuals and small businesses (less than $1 million USD in annual revenue). Look for this option, as it provides access to all Syncfusion products.

**Apply for the Community License**: Fill out the application for the Community License. You’ll need to provide some information about yourself and your company (if applicable).

Remember, while the Community License is free, it is intended for small companies and individual developers. Larger companies or those with higher revenue must opt for a paid license. Always ensure that you are compliant with the licensing terms to avoid any legal issues.
