The **SfPricingDev** project shows a first cut at replicating and improving upon an AtomicPricing widget, but rendered as a Blazor component.

NOTE: the SfPricingWidget has not been generalized to work with multiple products and/or pricing schemes since my scenario is relatively fixed.  It should be pretty easy to generalize the component, though, but  I'll leave that as an exercise to others.
