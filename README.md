The **SfPricingDev** project shows a first cut at replicating and improving upon an AtomicPricing widget, but rendered az a Blazor component.

My own need is pretty basic so I may elect to keep the component as-is, although I may opt to package the component further if there's interest.  One thing I will definitely do is to generalize the PricingHelper and MiscExtenders, which hard-code most of the settings.

The "CHOOSE PLAN" buttons will also need to be integrated with ChargeBee, but I'll leave that for later.
